Create a program that will intake attribute values and return an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI).

To do this, I will follow the workflow from this week's lectures using the Input function and Print function.
I will request the user to input their weight in kg, and their height in cm.
I originally thought of using the 'int' type but changed to 'float' to account for decimal places.
I will then convert these values (as inputs return 'string' format) to floats so I can use them to calculate thei BMI.
I will calcuate BMI based on the given formula (weight / height in metres squared) and return the user's BMI.
I then thank the user for using the program.

I started researching the layout of a BMI calculator from Stack Overflow (1)
For converting cm to m^2, I searched for the correct formula and used the formula on Python Programming (2).
General usage queries were resolved by consulting recommended testbook (3).
